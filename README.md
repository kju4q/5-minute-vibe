## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- A Farcaster developer account for authentication

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/5-min-vibes.git
cd 5-min-vibes
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Copy the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the required environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

4. Update the `.env.local` file with your Farcaster credentials:

```
FARCASTER_CLIENT_ID=your_farcaster_client_id
FARCASTER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_farcaster_client_secret
FARCASTER_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/farcaster/callback
```

### Setting up Farcaster Authentication

1. Go to the [Farcaster Developer Dashboard](https://warpcast.com/~/developers)
2. Sign in with your Farcaster account
3. Create a new app with the following details:
   - Name: 5 Min Vibes
   - Redirect URI: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/farcaster/callback (or your production URL)
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env.local` file

### Running the application

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Design Philosophy

The UI is designed to be soft, minimal, and seamless with a baby pink background and soft white font. The text input fields are fluid and inviting, with subtle animations to make interactions feel smooth. The goal is to create a calming, personal space for daily journaling.

## AI Quote Generation

The app uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate unique inspirational quotes focused on mindfulness, gratitude, and personal growth. To minimize API calls, quotes are cached and reused, with new quotes generated only when needed. Fallback quotes are available in case the API is unavailable.

## Configuration

To configure the OpenAI integration:

1. Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Add it to your `.env.local` file
3. You can adjust the quote generation parameters in the `src/app/api/ai-quote/route.ts` file

## Motivation

This app is inspired by the "Five Minute Journal" physical notebook, which has been proven to boost positivity, reduce anxiety, and improve overall well-being through the practice of daily gratitude.
